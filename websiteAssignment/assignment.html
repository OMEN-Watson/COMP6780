  <h1><b> My assignment.html page for linking to assignment items for your Website Assesment</b></h1>
  <p><br></p>
  <p>This page is the marking guide to your website that your tutor will use to find your elements. Do not name this
    page anything other than assignment.html (all lower case) or else we may not be able to find and mark your
    assignment elements.<span>&nbsp; </span>How to use this page:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Please, link this page to your website's index.html page</li>
    <li>over time, link each assignment task listed below to its location in your website as soon as you have started it
    </li>
    <li>replace the "notes" paragraph with your notes or
      delete if you have no notes - your notes will help us understand and
      mark your site so you should explain things. Maybe you did a task
      differently from the way we specified it, either because your way is
      better (tell us) or minimally or not at all to fit in with your site's
      look and feel (tell us) or ... (also tell us). So, for example, a video
      might spoil the look and feel. What you do is make one anyway, link to
      it from this assessment.html page and explain in the <i>Notes</i> why
      it's not linked to from your public version of your web site. You can
      style this page as your like, so long as you keep the links to the
      assignment tasks.</li>
    <li>provide link to report where indicated</li>
    <li>delete these instructions when you are ready</li>
  </ul>
