  <h1><b> My assignment.html page for linking to assignment items for your Website Assesment</b></h1>
  <p><br></p>
  <p>This page is the marking guide to your website that your tutor will use to find your elements. Do not name this
    page anything other than assignment.html (all lower case) or else we may not be able to find and mark your
    assignment elements.<span>&nbsp; </span>How to use this page:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Please, link this page to your website's index.html page</li>
    <li>over time, link each assignment task listed below to its location in your website as soon as you have started it
    </li>
    <li>replace the "notes" paragraph with your notes or
      delete if you have no notes - your notes will help us understand and
      mark your site so you should explain things. Maybe you did a task
      differently from the way we specified it, either because your way is
      better (tell us) or minimally or not at all to fit in with your site's
      look and feel (tell us) or ... (also tell us). So, for example, a video
      might spoil the look and feel. What you do is make one anyway, link to
      it from this assessment.html page and explain in the <i>Notes</i> why
      it's not linked to from your public version of your web site. You can
      style this page as your like, so long as you keep the links to the
      assignment tasks.</li>
    <li>provide link to report where indicated</li>
    <li>delete these instructions when you are ready</li>
  </ul>

  <h1><b>Website Release 3.0</b></h1>
  <h2><b>3.1 Reflections</b></h2>
  <p>The website was initially built with a main content area and a static HTML sidebar. Because of this
    arrangement,<br>
    the sidebar and the display area shared a single JavaScript file, which made it difficult to manage scripts that<br>
    were unique to particular pages. Because it restricted the site's components' flexibility and modularity, this<br>
    arrangement was not optimal.
    <br>
    <br>
    In order to solve this, I looked into ways to give the scripting for each section of the page more independence.
    <br>
    Iframes were the solution I came across during my research, and at first it seemed like the ideal one. I was able to
    <br>
    separate the JavaScript environments of the sub-pages from the sidebar by embedding iframes within the main content
    area.<br>
    The ability for each iframe to reference its own JavaScript files subsequently made managing scripts much easier
    and<br>
    improved sub-page functionality.
    <br>
    <br>
    But putting iframes into practice wasn't without its difficulties. The move necessitated considerable alterations
    <br>
    to the website's architecture for a novice in JavaScript. I put a lot of effort into changing the layout and <br>
    troubleshooting iframe integration problems, like responsiveness and navigation handling. I learned a lot about <br>
    troubleshooting and web architecture adaptation from this rigorous but worthwhile process.
    <br><br>
    I learned via additional research and community feedback that iframes are a little out of date and should not be<br>
    used for contemporary web applications after implementing them and overcoming the initial difficulties.
    <br>Performance,
    security, and accessibility issues were raised because iframes can make content less secure, load more slowly,<br>
    and
    create serious accessibility issues.
    <br><br>
    This revelation was eye-opening. It made me understand how crucial it is to conduct in-depth study and involve
    the<br>
    community before choosing a technological solution. Alternatively, I could have chosen more contemporary and<br>
    reliable solutions like JavaScript frameworks or libraries that facilitate component-based architectures, <br>like
    React
    or Vue.js, if I had done more research on current web development trends and standards beforehand.<br> Within the
    development community, these technologies are widely supported and recommended,<br> and they provide improved
    security and performance.
