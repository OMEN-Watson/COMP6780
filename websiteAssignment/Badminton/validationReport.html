          <h1>1· Lin Dan</h1>
          <p>Lin Dan, born on October 14, 1983, in Longyan, Fujian, China, is one of the greatest badminton players in
            history. Often referred to by his nickname "Super Dan," he is celebrated for his exceptional agility,
            powerful smashes, and tactical genius. Lin Dan completed the "Super Grand Slam" by the age of 28, having
            won all nine major titles in international badminton — Olympic Games, World Championships, World Cup,
            Thomas Cup, Sudirman Cup, Super Series Masters Finals, All England Open, Asian Games, and Asian
            Championships. He is a two-time Olympic gold medalist, winning in 2008 and 2012, and a five-time World
            Champion. <br> <br>Lin Dan's rivalry with Malaysian player Lee Chong Wei has been particularly famed,
            contributing
            to the global popularity of badminton.</p>
